# Trace Anjay
> Download Anjay, update example and trace their packets with WireShark

[Anjay](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay) is a LwM2M Client develop by AV System and [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a packet analyzer. The idea is to use WireShark to trace the comunication between the LwM2M Client (Anjay) and the LwM2M Server (Coiote), and in this way undertand the behavior of Coiote and how to show and update LwM2M Objects in its web application.
